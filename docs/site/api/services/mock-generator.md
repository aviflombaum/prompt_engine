# MockGenerator Service Documentation

## Overview

The `MockGenerator` class is part of the `PromptEngine::Documentation` module. It serves as a simple documentation generator primarily used for testing and proof-of-concept purposes. The class does not require a large language model (LLM) to generate documentation, making it lightweight and easy to use for mock documentation generation.

## Purpose and Responsibility

The primary purpose of the `MockGenerator` class is to generate mock documentation for models, controllers, and services within a Ruby on Rails application. This documentation includes details such as class descriptions, attributes, methods, and usage examples. The generator aims to facilitate the understanding and testing of code in development environments without the need for complex setups or external dependencies.

## Usage Examples

### Initialization

To use the `MockGenerator`, instantiate it with an optional `output_dir` parameter which specifies the directory where the generated documentation will be stored.

```ruby
generator = PromptEngine::Documentation::MockGenerator.new(output_dir: "custom/docs")
```

### Generating Documentation

While the methods for generating specific documentation (models, controllers, services) are private and meant for internal use, you would typically have a method or task in your environment that triggers these documentations:

```ruby
# Example method that might exist in your environment to trigger documentation generation
def generate_all_documentation
  generator = PromptEngine::Documentation::MockGenerator.new
  models_analysis.each do |analysis|
    generator.send(:generate_model_documentation, analysis)
  end
  # Similar for controllers and services
end
```

## Method Documentation

Due to the nature of this class (used for internal, testing purposes), detailed public method documentation is less critical. However, understanding the internal methods can be beneficial:

- **generate_model_documentation(analysis)**: Generates documentation for a model based on provided analysis data. It includes attributes, associations, validations, and methods.
- **generate_controller_documentation(analysis)**: Produces documentation for a controller, outlining different API endpoints and their behaviors.
- **generate_service_documentation(analysis)**: Creates documentation for a service class, focusing on its purpose, public methods, and typical usage patterns.

These methods utilize helper methods such as `generate_mock_model_doc`, `generate_mock_controller_doc`, and `generate_mock_service_doc` to construct the actual content of the documentation.

## Error Scenarios

While using `MockGenerator`, consider the following error scenarios:

1. **Invalid Directory**: If the `output_dir` provided does not exist or cannot be written to, ensure the directory is created or permissions are adjusted.
2. **Incorrect Analysis Format**: The documentation generation methods expect a specific format for the analysis hash. Errors or unexpected behavior may occur if the format is incorrect.

## Best Practices

When utilizing the `MockGenerator`, adhere to the following best practices:

1. **Clear and Concise Analysis Data**: Ensure that the analysis data provided to the documentation methods is clear, concise, and correctly formatted. This helps in generating accurate and useful documentation.
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the documentation up-to-date with changes in the codebase to ensure continued relevance and usefulness.
3. **Secure Output Directory**: Make sure that the output directory is secure and backed up as needed to prevent data loss.

The `MockGenerator` serves as a practical tool for generating straightforward and essential documentation during the early stages of development or in testing scenarios where complex documentation is not required.
